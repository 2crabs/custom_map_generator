# Map Generator for Teardown
This is meant as an easy way to create more complex maps for Teardown. It allows you to use more colors than you are able to with the voxscript heightmap normally used.

It uses 3 different images to generate the file vox file.
- **Material**: Which material to use over the existing rock
- **Color**: The texture that is overlayed on top of the voxels 
- **Height**: The height of each part of of the generated vox.
